In this project, we'll be exploring the public data New York City has published on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. 

Specifically, we are interested in investigating the following: 
- the correlations between various school characteristics (including safety score, graduation rate, etc.) and students' SAT scores
- racial/gender differences in SAT scores
- geographic differences in schools' safety scores
